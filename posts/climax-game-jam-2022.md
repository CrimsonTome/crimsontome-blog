I was fortunate enough this weekend to take part in the Climax Studios Game Jam in support of Mind as part of the Freeside time. This consisted of myself, [Chris](https://github.com/admgecko) and [Job](https://github.com/pianoguru). This was Job and I's first game jam, while Chris had done one previously in 2020.
