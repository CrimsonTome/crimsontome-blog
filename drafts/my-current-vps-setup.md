A few months ago I made a [post](https://blog.crimsontome.com/posts/PVE/) on Proxmox and what I run/ran on my physical home server, and whilst I have now fixed my hardware issues (by geting completely different hardware) I am yet to recreate all my VMs on that machine.  So in the meantime, using my [GitHub Student](https://education.github.com/pack) credits I have setup a VPS with [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets).
