## An GitHub overview - by someone new to it

### First, a little background information

A few years ago, back when I was in secondary school doing some group Python programming in year 9 I though to myself something like: This is interesting, working in a team on different parts then compiling them all together. But working on it all at the same time is a bit awkward to do. Is there a better way of doing this?  
Introducing GitHub, the answer to all my questions. Sadly I only found out about GitHub's purpose years later once I was in college, and even then I never used it to contribute to open-source projects with others. I just browsed through lots of programs and just thought it was a place to archive code.
