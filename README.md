[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/cae7db9a-2b54-481d-b8df-14553c339ed2/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/crimsontome/deploys)  


After abandoning the github pages blog, I had many static site generators and hosting providers recommended to me aside from Jekyll and GHPages. I had already tried Eleventy with GHPages and wanted to try that with Netlify. So, that is what I am doing.  
This blog uses the [eleventy base blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) as a framework.
