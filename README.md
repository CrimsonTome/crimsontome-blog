# CrimsonTome's Blog


After abandoning the github pages blog, I had many static site generators and hosting providers recommended to me aside from Jekyll and GHPages. I had already tried Eleventy with GHPages and wanted to try that with Netlify. So, that is what I am doing.  
This blog uses the [eleventy base blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) as a framework.  

EDIT: Site is now hosted on my Docker server as the base url for my site has been broken for some time, and this prevents Netlify from randomly breaking npm packages. Can be viewed at <https://blog.crimsontome.com>

Much of the documentation will be through blog posts rather than here, for now anyway. You can read the first blog [here](https://blog.crimsontome.com/posts/making-your-own-blog/).

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on adding to this repository.
